Guide to Using the Scrambled Puzzle Data

This guide explains how to load and work with the contents of the scrambled_puzzle_data.pkl file you received. This file contains the 81 image pieces, which have been randomly rotated and scrambled.

Prerequisites

You must have Python installed, along with the following libraries:

NumPy: For handling image array data.

Pillow (PIL): For working with images.

Pickle: This is a standard Python library used to load the file.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy Pillow


How to Load the Data

The puzzle data is stored as a Python list of dictionaries. You can use the pickle module to load it directly.

1. The Loading Function

The original script (image_puzzle_scrambler.py on the Canvas) already includes a function to handle this. For convenience, here is a standalone Python snippet demonstrating how to load the file:
```python
import pickle
import numpy as np

def load_scrambled_data(filename: str = "scrambled_puzzle_data.pkl"):
    """
    Loads the list of scrambled piece data from a binary pickle file.
    """
    try:
        # 'rb' for read binary mode
        with open(filename, 'rb') as f: 
            pieces_list = pickle.load(f)
        print(f"Successfully loaded {len(pieces_list)} pieces.")
        return pieces_list
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f"Error: Puzzle data file not found at path: {filename}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error loading scrambled data: {e}")
        return None

# Make sure 'scrambled_puzzle_data.pkl' is in the same directory as this script.
scrambled_data = load_scrambled_data()

if scrambled_data:
    print(f"Total pieces loaded: {len(scrambled_data)}")
    
    # Accessing the first piece's data:
    first_piece = scrambled_data[0]
    
    # The image data is stored as a NumPy array under the 'data' key.
    image_array = first_piece['data']
    print(f"Shape of the first piece's image data: {image_array.shape}") 
    
    # Note: The 'correct_index' and 'applied_rotation_deg' keys are the answer key.
    # For solving the puzzle, you should ignore these metadata fields.
    
    print("\n--- Puzzle Solving Steps ---")
    print("1. You must figure out the correct position (0-80) for each piece.")
    print("2. You must figure out the correct rotation (0, 90, 180, or 270 degrees) for each piece.")
```
